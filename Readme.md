# FakeServer

FakeServer is a "plugin" for [sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/) that let's you define routes that will return a specific JSON payload. FakeServer is handy for situations where you are developing a client-side application for an API that doesn't exist yet or for making testing with sinon a bit more user-friendly.
